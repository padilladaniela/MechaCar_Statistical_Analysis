* Fig. 1 is the summary of the linear regression for MechaCar mpg.
  * Based on the Linear regression model there are two values that would have a high level of significance in predicting the mpg of MechaCar      prototypes. The vehicle_length and ground_clearance are the variables with a p-value less than 0.05 to several powers. The only other          variable that is close to 0.05 is the vehicle_weight. The p-value 0.0776 is not considered significant but should be included in the            consideration for mpg since it is so close.
The slope of the linear model would be considered as zero due to it being a incredibly small decimal.
The residual standard error is 8.774 which is low for the linear model with 44 degrees of freedom. This indicates that the linear model is decent at predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
