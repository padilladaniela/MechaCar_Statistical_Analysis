# Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Fig. 1 is the summary of the linear regression for MechaCar mpg.
  * Based on the Linear regression model there are two values that would have a high level of significance in predicting the mpg of MechaCar      prototypes. The vehicle_length and ground_clearance are the variables with a p-value less than 0.05 to several powers. The only other          variable that is close to 0.05 is the vehicle_weight. The p-value 0.0776 is not considered significant but should be included in the            consideration for mpg since it is so close.
The slope of the linear model would be considered as zero due to it being a incredibly small decimal.
The residual standard error is 8.774 which is low for the linear model with 44 degrees of freedom. This indicates that the linear model is decent at predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

1. The variance for all manufacturing lots is 62.29 based on the summary statistics for the PSI of MechaCar suspension coils which is below the threshold for the design specification of the suspension coils.

3. Based on the the summary statistics for the PSI of each MechaCar Manufacturing, the Lot 1 and Lot 2 have a small amount of variance, 0.98 and 7.47, in the suspension coils which is significantly below the design threshold. Lot 3 has a variance of 170.29 which is significantly over the design specification threshold.

- The p-value for all manufacturing lots is 0.06 which is not considered statistically significant, but is very close to normal for the population mean. This indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis.

- The p-value for lot 1 is 0.05% which is not considered statistically significant. This indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis.

![imagine5](https://github.com/padilladaniela/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Fig_6%20t-test%20lot%202.png)
- The p-value for Lot 2 is 0.61 which is also very low and not considered statistically significant.

![imagine5](https://github.com/padilladaniela/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Fig_7%20t-test%20lot%207.png)
- The p-value for Lot 3 is 0.042 which is statistically significant.
